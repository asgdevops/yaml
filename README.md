## Definition

> _YAML stood for “Yet Another Markup Language”. The acronym was later changed to “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”._

## Purpose
- It is most comonly used to create configuration files.
  - For example:
  - **Ansible** automation processes.
  - **Docker Compose** build files.
  - **GitHub** version control.
  - **Kubernetes** resources and deployments.
